# Tier 1 Week 3

This week, we will continue to put more into your tool belt by tackling methods for handling tasks multiple times and storing multiple pieces of information.

## Topics Covered

* arrays
* loops: `for`, `while`, `for of`

## Assignment

As always, start off by forking and cloning this repository from GitHub. Open the code up in Atom to get started.

Remember `console.log()` is your friend and you can use it in conjunction with the browser console to see the output of your code as you go.

### Files Provided
This week you have a folder: `assignment`:

In the `assignment` folder, you have the following files:

- [ ] *checkpoints/loops.txt* (Required Features)

There are questions in each of the .txt files, answer them inside of the file.

#### Levels of Difficulty

Here is a reminder of what the levels are, and:

* what to expect when attempting each one
* if they are required or not

Mode | Description
